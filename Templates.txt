Here are some important things to note regarding DS8K updates/upgrades:
•    The minimum required code bundle that is supported by remote code loads is 87.51.95.0
◦    If the code bundle is below this level, the code load must be performed on-site
•    A Transformation Code Load (code upgrade) is if the current bundle is running at 88.0.x.x, 88.1.x.x, or 88.2.x.x and the target bundle is at 88.3.x.x and above
◦    The pre-load is expected to take 6 hours, and the activation is expected to take 6 hours for a total of 12 hours
•    A Standard Code Load (code update) is for all non-transformation code loads
◦    The pre-load is expected to take 4 hours, and the activation is expected to take 4 hours for a total of 8 hours
•    When we pre-load the code, it is a non-disruptive process where we download the necessary files to the machine and ensure it is ready for a code load
In order to process your request, we require the following information:
•    Connection Method (AOS/xRSC):
•    HMC 1 Serial:
•    HMC 2 Serial (if applicable):
•    Current Code Bundle:
